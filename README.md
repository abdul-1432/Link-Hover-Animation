## Usage

To use these link hover animations in your project, follow these steps:

1. Include the CSS file in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path-to/link-hover-animation.css">
   ```

2. Add the desired animation class to your links. For example, to use the "bounce" animation, add the `lh-bounce` class to your link's HTML:

   ```html
   <a href="#" class="lh-bounce">Hover me</a>
   ```

3. That's it! Now, when users hover over the link, the specified animation will be applied.
